# Gnosis Hive 🐝 Github Action

This action is a wrapper around [Gnosis Hive](https://github.com/gnosischain/hive). It allows you to run tests with different clients and simulators. It also supports uploading test results to S3 and/or as a workflow artifact.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This action is still under development and may introduce breaking changes. If you want to use it in your workflows, make sure to reference to a specific commit hash or tag/release.

| `workflow_artifact_prefix` | Name of the workflow prefix. If not provided, the prefix will be the simulator and client name. | No | - |

## Examples

### Simple example doing sync tests with the latest nethermind-gnosis

```yaml
- uses: gnosischain/hive-github-action@master
  with:
    client: nethermind-gnosis
    simulator: gnosis/sync
```

### With custom client config

You can customize the [client configuration](https://github.com/gnosischain/hive/blob/master/docs/commandline.md#client-build-parameters). This allows using different docker files that are available for each client and their respective build arguments.

```yaml
env:
  CLIENT_CONFIG: |
    - client: nethermind-gnosis
      nametag: prague-devnet-5
      dockerfile: git
      build_args:
        github: NethermindEth/nethermind
        tag: my-custom-branch
```

Then you can use the `CLIENT_CONFIG` environment variable in your workflow.

```yaml
- uses: gnosischain/hive-github-action@master
  with:
    client: nethermind-gnosis
    simulator: gnosis/sync
    client_config: ${{ env.CLIENT_CONFIG }}
```

### Uploading the results directory to S3

You'll need to create an rclone config and base64 encode it. Then store it as a github actions secret on your repository.

An example rclone config could look like this:

```toml
# Content of rclone.conf
[s3]
type = s3
provider = Cloudflare
region = auto
endpoint = https://your-r2-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
access_key_id = your-access-key-id
secret_access_key = your-secret-access-key
no_check_bucket = true
```

Then you can run `base64 -w 0 rclone.conf` and store the output as a github actions secret.

Afterwards you just need to reference the secret for the `rclone_config` input.

```yaml
- uses: gnosischain/hive-github-action@master
  with:
    client: nethermind-gnosis
    simulator: gnosis/sync
    client_config: ${{ env.CLIENT_CONFIG }}
    s3_upload: true
    s3_bucket: my-bucket
    s3_path: my-path
    rclone_config: ${{ secrets.RCLONE_CONFIG }}
```

### Just upload the website using hiveview without running tests

```yaml
- uses: gnosischain/hive-github-action@master
  with:
    website_upload: true # This is required to upload the website
    skip_tests: true # This is required to skip the tests
    s3_upload: true
    s3_bucket: my-bucket
    s3_path: my-path
    rclone_config: ${{ secrets.RCLONE_CONFIG }}
```

### Uploading the results directory as a GitHub workflow artifact

This will upload the test results as a workflow artifact. By default the artifact prefix will be the simulator and client name. You can override this by providing a `workflow_artifact_prefix` input.
```yaml
- uses: gnosischain/hive-github-action@master
  with:
    client: nethermind-gnosis
    simulator: gnosis/sync
    workflow_artifact_upload: true
    # workflow_artifact_prefix: my-custom-prefix
```

## Local testing and development

To test the action locally, you can run [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) with the following command:

```bash
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" -W '.github/workflows/test.yaml'
```

Or if you configured a custom runner, you can run `act` with the following command:

```bash
act -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" -W '.github/workflows/your-workflow.yaml' -P your-self-hosted-runner=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
```
